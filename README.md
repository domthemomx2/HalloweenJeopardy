During this game the players will be able to keep up with their score, which is located next to their names. The game will begin once players have reached the screen with the categories and category value cards. The players will take turns, beginning with Player One. The player will start by choosing a value card under the category of their choosing. If answered correctly, the player will earn the points associated with their value card. If answered incorrectly, they will not earn the points associated with their value card and the value card will go back on to the board to be played again.
